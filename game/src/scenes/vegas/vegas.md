1. Lav's character model should disappear temporarily while the wall is up.
2. Ending texts should be better
    more like winning an item. You've earned: Her love! (a heart symbol now appears, and she becomes your companion)
3. Beginning transition from previous scene should be better
    a. Several images of las vegas, followed by a text that says "...in Vegas..."
4. Character model for lav should have wedding ring around finger when the walls go up.
    a. Maybe some further emphasis on her being married.
5. Divorce papers should maybe burst out of the center instead of just falling from above the screen?
