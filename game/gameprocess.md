1. Start by interacting with dad
    He says some bullshit
    Maybe dialogue options, and you respond
    Either way you begin a fight. (spacebar to strike, b to block, down arrow to dodge)
    `FightScene`

2. After defeating your dad and completing fight scene, you're in a bar
    `BarScene`
    Bar scene has you talking to the bartender, yourself, taking a drink, etc
    You get up, and the bar becomes a labrynth, and you have to navigate your way out
        Optional: have the bartender ask you to leave, you get up and you're being followed by a bouncer, and you navigate the labrynth to escape (like PacMan)

3. After escaping, transition in a club scene, you're walking up to girls and have to pick the right one
    `ClubScene`

4. After choosing the right one, her husband appears out of thin air, and a wall appears between you, and you're given a sledgehammer to break the wall
    `WallScene`
    Spacebar to break the wall, move so different parts of the wall are broken

5. After breaking the wall, you see her, the husband explodes, blood everywhere, and you're given (points? or You've earned: Her Love!, something funny), and she becomes your companion
    `CompanionScene`

6. Then you're in a car and have to avoid obscales & exits
    (Optional, being chased by police)
    `CarScene`

7. You reach your destination (home).
    2 options: either you wake up the next day and she's got breakfast waiting for you
        or: you just walk inside together and there's like a candle lit dinner?
    `HomeScene`
