Timmy, this is the first birthday I have the privilege of spending with you. 
From the moment I met you, something in me starved, howled. 
A hunger I did not know my body could feel—raw, desperate, insatiable. 
You are fire and velocity, bold and brazen, reckless and magnificent. 

But you are warmth, too. A hearth in the dead of winter. 
You are kindness. A gooey center, a young emotional loving child. 
You are loyalty carved from bone, unwavering, unshaken. 
There is nothing false in you; your very breath thrums with life, more vivid, 
more searing than anyone I have ever known. 

And you, with your ridiculous jokes 
and your laughter that crashes against my ribs like waves. 
I have never laughed like this before. 
Your passion burns, it devours, 
it lifts me into a world I never dared to believe in. 
Every moment with you is a chapter I never want to end, 
a storybook where the pages turn too fast.

This is the first time I have watched you step deeper into time, 
the first year I have witnessed you grow older. 
And I want more—selfishly, endlessly. 
I want to watch the years carve their poetry into your skin, 
to trace each line, 
to hold time by its throat and beg it to slow, 
to stretch each second until I have wrung every last drop of you.
I love you. More today than yesterday, more tomorrow than today.
Happy birthday, my love.
